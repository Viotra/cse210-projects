I went to work with no one. I/We went to make money. While I/we were there, I helped facilitate the New Hire Orientation, but was pulled out to shop for CO2 Laser Engravers. I felt overwhelmed.
I went to my room with my children. I/We went to try and sleep. While I/we were there, I couldn't sleep and tried to do homework instead, my son turned on video games, and my daughter struggled to put on some pants. I felt restless.
